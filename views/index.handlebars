        <h3>Fall is officially here!!</h3>
          <p>
            Although... with the 90 degree weather it certainly doesn’t feel like it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though we really do not see leaves changing colors, this begins our season of changing license plate colors!!! The
            snowbirds will soon begin to arrive here from many different states.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enjoy the empty beaches now! These are the glory days of fall for all of us locals!

          <b>Irene Madden</b>   has lived here at Forest Lakes for almost three years. 
            Perhaps you have seen her laying out at the pool regularly!
          </p>
          <p>
            H: Where were you born, Irene?
          </p>
          <p>
            Saskatchewan, Canada.<br>
            My mother was an immigrant. My parents were form Ukraine. I was the first one in my family to finish high school and the
            first one who went to college. I was raised in a large Ukrainian community there in Saskatchewan.
          </p>
            <p>
              H: What was your career?
            </p>
            <p>
              Starting in 1967 I would work for 3 weeks every summer at the fair in Toronto. I made a product sold nowhere else: rectangular
              waffles from scratch. The machine we used was made from melted down war parts. It made 12 waffles at a time. And we
              would put a square of ice cream on a hot waffle. It was famous in Toronto. People waited for it. Large families would
              come and order 16 at a time. It was a show! People loved watching me throw waffles.
              I also worked for the welfare department in Toronto. But eventually the company that did the fair asked if we wanted to
              come on the road with them. I said sure! My daughter Maggie would take her homework with her on the road. It was a choice to
              further my education or go on the road. I chose going on the road. What good memories we had!
              <br>
              That’s how I ended up in Florida: All the show people came to Sarasota!
            </p>
            <p>
              H: How did you end up at Forest Lakes?
            </p>
              <div class="mb-2">
                <img src="/img/october21.jpeg" width="50%" style="float: left; margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px" class="rounded" alt="...">
            <p>
              I was living in LA, but I needed to be with my granddaughter. My daughter Maggie had passed away.
              <br>
              I was watching NCIS one day. I saw a receipt on the show with the town named Sarasota on it, so I looked up Sarasota. The condos were
              so cheap. I bought this condo off the internet in December 2018.
            </p>
            <p>
              H: What do you like about Forest Lakes?
            </p>
            <p>
              Everyday when I pick up my granddaughter or take her to school I think "it’s great to be alive. I’m in Sarasota . And
              I’m a citizen! I love being here. The birds are singing. There are clouds in the sky. I’m so happy to be alive and doing it here!"
            </p>  
                <p>
                  H: Do you cook Ukrainian food?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cabbage rolls are the most well-known Ukrainian food. My brother and I use WhatsApp and make the same food together
                  since I have my mother’s recipes in my head.  ~~
                </p>
              
            
              </div>
            <p style="clear: both;">
              Who knew we had a show woman on the property! And I think we all would love to try real homemade cabbage rolls…. And of
              course…. A homemade waffle!

                      <p>
                        September finds us waiting for cooler weather and hoping we can escape hurricane season without a scratch.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Please remember to check the hurricane preparedness link and stock up on necessary items like water and canned foods.

                        We are pleased with the concrete repair work that was done. Matter of fact, we saw a few more places that needed fixed
                        and will pay for those to be fixed as well! So there will be some more repairs made soon. Then it will be time to
                        paint.
                        Thankfully with the help of our willing volunteers we can do that in house and save thousands!!

                        answered
                        a few questions:
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        HEATHER: Barbara where are you originally from?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        BARBARA: Buffalo, New York.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        HEATHER: How long have you lived here?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        BARBARA: For 35 years but we did leave for Georgia and South Carolina during that time.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        HEATHER: How did you end up here in Sarasota?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        BARBARA: A friend of mine was a realtor. He told me about this place. Unseen we packed up and came. It was spotless.
                        We came in
                        to a house full of furniture and brought a truck full of furniture!
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        BARBARA: The window in the kitchen looks out to what seems like a private yard. Being in the kitchen is my favorite,
                        because
                        I like to cook.

                        <p>
                          BARBARA: This rose bush was planted by the couple that lived here before. Her name was Barbara too. Her husband put
                          it here for
                          her. When we moved in, Patrick (my husband) would have the roses for me by my coffee in the kitchen after I got up
                          in the morning. Two
                          couples have enjoyed these roses!
                        </p>
                      
                        <p>
                          Barbara has very fond memories of those roses and her beloved Patrick. She told a story about how when her and
                          Patrick
                          would be driving and she would see an animal that had been hit on the road and Patrick knew how much it hurt her to
                          see
                          that. So he would always say: “Don’t worry. It’s only rags beside the road. It’s only rags”.

                      <p>Have you noticed the crocodile in our pool? It has been serving a dual purpose! It is to scare away the birds and

                        from drinking the pool water and leaving behind little messes. <br>
                        So please remember to put the crocodile back in the pool before you leave the pool area. <br>
                        But that crocodile has also been such a hit with the visiting
                        kids! Thanks to Sharon for buying the crocodile! 🐊🐊</p>

              <p>Here we are! It’s July!</p>
              <p>If you didn’t notice, baby it’s hot outside! Work is still going on with sanding down and painting the stairs. The
                work
                has slowed a bit because of the heat. But we are always looking for volunteers! Even if you are busy and don’t have
                time, at least you can come out and pat the volunteers on the back. They need your support!</p>
              <p>Please keep up with the news regarding hurricanes! There is a link on this webpage that will take you directly to the
                FPL webpage about hurricane preparedness and what you need to do BEFORE a hurricane arrives. In the event of an
                approaching storm, if you need help moving things off your lanai, let us know. We can help you. Or at the very least,
                we
                can find someone with muscles who can help you!!</p>
              <p>Do you have auto pay set up for your monthly maintenance fee? Have you thought about it but don’t know what to do?
                Let
                us know! It is so simple to set up. It makes everything so much easier for you when you have auto pay. You don’t have
                to
                worry about late fees and you save yourself a stamp!</p>
              <p>Please note that the leak protocol instructions have been added to the list of "Important Numbers and Links."</p>
              <p>We are still trying to find ways to save money. As you probably have noticed, we have one man who comes now to cut
                the
                grass on Fridays. He charges less than the previous lawn crew. But still, the monthly charge is $500. It was mentioned
                that we could buy our own small riding lawnmower and in a few months be paying nothing for lawn work. We have a
                weed-eater. But the question is, would there be enough volunteers to take their turn on the riding lawnmower? Could we
                take turns by building? Think about it seriously. Think about if you would be able to occasionally volunteer. It would
                be nice to have a definite list of those who think they could do it. We will be discussing this at the next meeting.
                If
                there are not enough people who are able to volunteer, then we will stick with the new lawn guy.</p>
              <p>Meeting coming soon!</p>
              <P>The front wall is completely finished! The lights were taken off, the glass cleaned and the black sconces painted.
                The
                next day after everything was finished, a young guy was seen throwing rocks at the lights and he shattered the vintage
                glass in both lights. Can you believe that?? Any ideas on how to replace the glass? We need ‘a design on a dime’ plan.
